#BROKR Stock Prediction App

The projet goal is to predict stock prices using deep learning. The deep learning algorithm is built on the LSTM based Recurrent Neural Network. Current model was only trained on the IBM stock data and app itself only shows the prediction for that stock. The test result of model is shown in the belowmentioned figure. In the next phase of the project it is aimed to have an application which can predict other stocks as well with high accuracy.
The repository contains training folder which has the dataset and also, python notebook for training. 
For running the application it needs to run app.py main file which is developed using Flask framework.
Web application itself is deployed on Heroku and if you want to check, you can use this link: https://brokr-app.herokuapp.com/
